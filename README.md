Both communication via USB and [Lantronix XPort](https://www.lantronix.com/products/xport/) are supported.

Note that not all commands of [MeCom](https://www.meerstetter.ch/customer-center/compendium/64-tec-controller-remote-control) are implemented at this time. Feel free to submit more commands via a Pull Request.

## Usage

### Connection
#### USB

```python
from meer_tec.interfaces import USB
from meer_tec.tec import TEC
usb = USB("COM3")
tec = TEC(usb, 0)
```

#### XPort
Create a connection to the XPort and pass it as an argument to one of the TECs

```python
from meer_tec.interfaces import USB
from meer_tec.tec import TEC
xp = XPort('192.168.1.123')
tec3 = TEC(xp, 3)
```

## Commands

The commands are implemented as properties. For example the target temperature
can be read by simply using

```python
tec3.target_temperature
23.0

tec3.target_temperature = 23.1
```
