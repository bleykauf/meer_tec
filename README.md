Currently, only communication via ethernet is supported (tested only with [Lantronix XPort](https://www.lantronix.com/products/xport/)).
Note that only a small subset of [MeCom](https://www.meerstetter.ch/customer-center/compendium/64-tec-controller-remote-control) is implemented at this time.

## Usage

Create a connection to the XPort and pass it as an argument to one of the TECs

```python
xp = XPort('192.168.1.123')
tec3 = TEC(xp, 3)
```

The commands are implemented as properties. For example the target temperature
can be read by simply using

```python
tec3.target_temperature
23.0

tec3.target_temperature = 23.1
```
